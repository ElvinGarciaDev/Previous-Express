## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS

A fetch request is made to the server with the word the user entered. In the backend, an isPalindrome() function determines if the word passed is a palindrome. If the word is a palindrome it gets stored in the MongoDB database. EJS is used to create dynamic HTML. The user has the option to delete any palindrome words stored in the database by clicking the trash icon.
